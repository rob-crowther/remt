Drawing tool calculations.

Drawing tools characteristics is as follows

+---------------+----------+------+--------+
| Tool          | Pressure | Tilt | Brush  |
+===============+==========+======+========+
| Ballpoint     |    Y     |  N   |   Y    |

| Fineliner     |    N     |  N   |   N    |

+---------------+----------+------+--------+
| Tilt pencil   |  Y (1)   |  Y   |   Y    |
+---------------+----------+------+--------+
| Brush         |    Y     |  Y   |   N    |
+---------------+----------+------+--------+
| Highlighter   |    N     |  N   |   N    |
+---------------+----------+------+--------+
| Eraser        |    N     |  N   |   N    |
+---------------+----------+------+--------+
| Erase Area    |    N     |  N   |  N (3) |
+---------------+----------+------+--------+

1. Tilt pencil uses pressure to distinguish between two brush
   versions - lighter or darker.
2. Highlighter has static width of 30px.
3. Some shapes have an irregular edge, could it be due to a brush?

Use color alpha only for highlighter and eraser area. All other tools
should use appropriate brushes at full opacity. For example, drawing with
pencil in exactly the same place does not make it darker. This also allows
to draw a single stroke of varying width with multiple lines in Cairo.
Otherwise, due to line overlap, we would have to draw a stroke with an
outline and fill.
